i	O
took	O
it	O
for	O
two	O

and	O
it	O
did	O
wonders	O

the	O

had	O
with	O
it	O
were	O
when	O
i	O
came	O
off	O

,	O
but	O
past	O
that	O
,	O
it	O
'	O
s	O
a	O
good	O
drug	O
.	O

was	O
initially	O
on	O
effexor	O
and	O
slowly	O
got	O
up	O
to	O
100	O
mg	O
a	O
day	O
.	O

was	O
on	O
this	O
for	O
several	O
years	O
,	O
had	O
back	O
surgery	O
and	O
wanted	O
to	O
quit	O
effexor	O
because	O
i	O
was	O
no	O
longer	O
depressed	O
or	O
in	O
pain	O
.	O

withdrawal	O
was	O
very	O
,	O
very	O
difficult	O
as	O
many	O
here	O
state	O
.	O

i	O
ended	O
up	O
staying	O
on	O
a	O
maintenance	O
dose	O
of	O
half	O
of	O
a	O
37	O
.	O

5	O
mg	O
tablet	O
.	O

after	O
a	O
year	O
or	O
so	O
on	O
this	O
i	O
had	O
more	B
spinal	I
problems	I
and	O
related	O
nerve	B
pain	I
.	O

upped	O
the	O
effexor	O
to	O
75	O
mg	O
without	O
much	O
pain	O
relief	O
.	O

i	O
now	O
switched	O
to	O
xr	O
150	O
mg	O
for	O
the	O
past	O
six	O
months	O
.	O

i	O
have	O
lots	O
of	O
neck	B
problems	O
(	O
ddd	O
,	O
herniation	B
,	O
stenosis	B
,	O
etc	O
)	O
so	O
i	O
thought	O
the	O
severe	B
pain	I
in	I
my	I
hands	I
and	I
arms	I
was	O
the	O
result	O
of	O
that	O
.	O

however	O
,	O
in	O
thinking	O
about	O
when	O
the	O
pain	O
increased	O
,	O
i	O
realized	O
that	O
it	O
coincided	O
with	O
my	O
switch	O
to	O
a	O
higher	O
dose	O
and	O
xr	O
.	O

to	O
compound	O
the	O
problem	O
,	O
i	O
was	O
put	O
on	O
diovan	O
160	O
mg	O
for	O
high	O
blood	O
pressure	O
at	O
the	O
same	O
time	O
.	O

so	O
i	O
don	O
'	O
t	O
really	O
know	O
if	O
the	O
increase	O
in	O
pain	O
is	O
related	O
only	O
to	O
the	O
effexor	O
xr	O
or	O
diovan	O
also	O
.	O

overall	O
,	O
effexor	O
did	O
very	O
well	O
relieving	O
my	O
depression	O
.	O

it	O
helped	O
keep	O
migraines	O
at	O
bay	O
and	O
i	O
had	O
tolerable	O
,	O
minimal	O
side	O
effects	O

really	O
nasty	O
