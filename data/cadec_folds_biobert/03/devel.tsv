my	O

did	O
not	O
send	O
me	O
a	O

prescription	O
like	O
he	O
had	O
the	O
last	O

so	O
i	O
did	O
not	O

that	O
he	O
wanted	O
me	O
to	O
get	O
it	O
refilled	O

so	O
i	O
went	O
off	O
of	O

and	O
within	O
two	O

i	O
was	O
feeling	O

again	O

even	O
took	O
a	O

i	O
walked	O
five	O

a	O

i	O
did	O
not	O

my	O
getting	O
better	O
with	O
my	O
coming	O
off	O
lipitor	O
,	O
unfortunately	O

then	O
i	O
had	O
an	O
appointment	O
with	O
my	O

he	O
said	O
i	O
should	O
have	O
refilled	O
that	O
prescription	O
by	O
calling	O
his	O
office	O

so	O
i	O
did	O
and	O
the	O
next	O
day	O
,	O
after	O
taking	O
only	O
one	O
pill	O
,	O
i	O
was	O
eighty	O

again	O

this	O

i	O
did	O

it	O
with	O
the	O

of	O

then	O
read	O
the	O
warnings	O
the	O
drug	O
store	O
gives	O
you	O
with	O
meds	O
and	O
found	O
that	O
my	O

were	O
the	O

as	O
what	O
they	O
warned	O
against	O
.	O

i	O
am	O
not	O
a	O
hypochondriac	O
and	O
i	O
never	O
read	O
those	O
warnings	O
so	O
this	O
was	O
not	O
a	O
head	O
thing	O

i	O
immediately	O
went	O
off	O
the	O
drug	O

a	O

have	O
the	O

eighty	O

that	O
i	O
will	O
ever	O

i	O
do	O
not	O

how	O
just	O
one	O

can	O
do	O
that	O
