my	O

did	O
not	O
send	O
me	O
a	O

like	O
he	O
had	O
the	O

i	O
did	O
not	O

that	O
he	O
wanted	O
me	O
to	O

so	O
i	O
went	O
off	O

within	O
two	O

i	O
was	O

with	O
my	O

unfortunately	O

then	O
i	O
had	O
an	O

with	O
my	O

said	O
i	O
should	O
have	O
refilled	O
that	O

did	O

the	O
next	O

i	O

read	O
the	O

you	O

i	O
