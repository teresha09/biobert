the	O

my	O

not	O
send	O
me	O
a	O

he	O
had	O
the	O

so	O
i	O
did	O
not	O
know	O
that	O
he	O
wanted	O
me	O
to	O
get	O
it	O

so	O
i	O
went	O
off	O

and	O
within	O
two	O

i	O
was	O
feeling	O

again	O

even	O
took	O
a	O

five	O

i	O
did	O

my	O
getting	O

with	O
my	O

,	O
unfortunately	O

then	O
i	O
had	O
an	O

with	O
my	O

he	O
said	O
i	O
should	O
have	O
refilled	O
that	O

by	O
calling	O
his	O
office	O

so	O
i	O
did	O
and	O
the	O
next	O

only	O
one	O

,	O
i	B
was	I

read	O
the	O

you	O

found	O
that	O

what	O
they	O
warned	O
against	O

i	O

not	O
a	O

i	O
never	O

this	O
was	O
not	O
a	O

i	O
immediately	O
