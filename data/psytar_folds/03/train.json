that way for as long as i can remember. i've been trying my best to bury my depression down,things in my past,such as abuse,rings i did not want to deal with. depression also runs in my family,my grandmother ,84, has finally taken anti depressants. amd now she's happier than ever. i hated reaching out for help,but i realized i did not want to live my whole life being as miserable as her,and wait until 84 to get help. the medication however is only a tool and i have to attend therapy,medication can't fix the abuse i've suffered,or my fear of men ad a resulting factor,that has to be dealt with in other ways and trying to bury it down just ate me up. i began to cut,and attempted suicide several times,i've been self harming since i was a kid. ive been unable to be in health relationships because of my fears,and would someday like a to jave a decent relationship. but that part has to come from me. the lexapro did wonders in helping my moods,so i could get to a place where i could work on my issues.
